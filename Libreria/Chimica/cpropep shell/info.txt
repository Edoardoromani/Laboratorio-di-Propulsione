Cpropepshell provides a graphical userinterface to operate Cpropep under Windows. Install Cpropepshell in the same working directory as the cpropep.exe. Cpropepshell uses the cpropep.conf to locate the propellant data file - just as cpropep.exe does.

Cpropep and related data files are not included in this downlaod. They are awailable at the rocket workbench website (http://rocketworkbench.sourceforge.net/). You will need both the cpropep-win-1.0.zip and the cpropep-data-1.0.zip.

Cpropep is aimed at solving 4 problems:
1) Adiabatic flame temperature
2) Frosen equilibrium
3) Shifting equilibrium
4) Fixed pressure and temperature equilibrium

Cpropepshell allows setting up calculations for all 4 types of problems. When only one problem is selected then the conditions for that particular problem is defined by the user. If more than one problem is solved at a time, the conditions are coupled in the following way:
- Fixed pressure and temperature equilibrium takes its own independent values for chamber pressure and temperature.
- Adiabatic flame temperature and frosen equilibrium and fixed equilibrium shares the same value of the chamber pressure.
- Frosen equilibrium and shifting equilibrium shares the same exit conditions.
